1. Fried Egg for Breakfast 
===========================

Since the beginning of this semester, I fried eggs for my roommate and I almost every morning. We all believe that there are many [health benefits of eggs,](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-eggs) and we are also addicted about the taste of fried egg. However, unlike the traditional fried eggs, the way I cook is slightly different yet could bring a amazoing experience for tongue.

**ingredients needed**
----------------------

-   two Omega-3 enriched eggs
-   sea salt
-   black pepper
-   a cup of water
-   sliced tomatoes or brocolli

-   ***why do we choose Omega-3 enriched eggs rather than conventional eggs?***

> The hens are raised the conventional way. The change is made to their feed. Their food is supplemented with Omega -3 (flax seeds are added to their food). They have a little freedom to roam outside. one tab of peanut oil

**tools needed**
----------------

-   a nonstick skillet
-   a lid

**steps**
---------

1.  Heat ***1tsp oil*** in nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until heat.

<!-- -->

1.  Break eggs and slip into pan, one egg one time. Stay in heat for one minute and reduce heat to low.

<!-- -->

1.  Add ***1/4 cups*** of water into the pan and cover the lid of the pan for using the water vapor to heat eggs.
    4.Hold for ***3-5 minutes*** until the whites start to set, and yolk start to become hard.
2.  Next step is open th lid and ***season a pinck of salt and pepper***.
3.  Last step is that slide eggs onto a plate and serve. Usually I would like to add some sliced tometoes on the side.

2. Here is a simple Quadratic Equation.
=======================================

-   ***a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c***
    -------------------------------------

> In algebra, a quadratic equation is any equation having the form *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c*, where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0.
> The quadratic formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation
> $$x=-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$$

3. What things were hard?
=========================

-   **The most challenging part of this class for me is fostering intution of how to munipulate
    varied funtions and syntax properly. After obtained certain knowledge of R from lecture,
    I still need time than I expected to think about what steps I should follow and what
    functions I could use in particular situation. In addition, since I am working with a
    sensitive program, I should be carful about every step, which is very time-consuming.**

what was easy?
==============

-   **I found that I could get what I am looking for from online resources even though they are not covered at class. **

Markdown?
=========

-   **This is my first time using learning markdown syntax, and it is a good experience. **

Did you need help to complete the assignment?
=============================================

-   **Frankly, without the help of tutorials and google, I could say that it is impossible to finish this assignment. However, learning by myself and digest what I found is the fastes way for me to getting familiar with R. **

How much time did it take to complete this HW?
==============================================

-   Watching at tutorials plus coding at Rstudio that took me 3~4 hours to complete this HW.

What was the most time consuming part?
======================================

-   Checking with every step I did and looking for the information I need for completing the HW is the most time consuming part.
