? Was this your first time writing unit tests?
Yes, this is my first time writing unit tests and it is fun! 
? On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the logic of testthat tests? (0 notat all, 10 very confusing)
I select 0. 
? Was this your first time working with ggvis?
If the previous practice does not count, this would be the first time officially working with ggvis and it is fun as well. ? On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the syntax of ggvis? (0 not at all,10 very confusing)
I select 0. Everything about data visualization made me excited and want explore more! 
? Was this your first time working with conditional panels in shiny?
It is true that this is the first time I am working with conditional panels in shiny. 
? On a scale from 0 to 10, how challenging you found to work with the conditional panels?(0 not at all, 10 very challenging)
It is not challenging, it just requires more attention and practice. I like it. 
? So far we?ve exposed you to three graphing paradigms in R: base plots, ggplot, andnow ggvis. Which do you like the most and why?
I like the ggvis most because it could be reactive with or without shiny app, which give me more control to manipulate data and plot. 
? Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?
I completed the hw mostly and my GSI helped me a lot. In addition, I discussed it with several friends. ? How much time did it take to complete this HW?
Officially, more than 15 hours, and I think it is worth it because what I learned is more than what I could tell!
? What was the most time consuming part?
Surprisingly, testthat tests and building function parts are most time consuming part instead of shinyapp building part to me.
